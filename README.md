  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <h4> After a successful career in customer service and sales within the banking, utilities, and telecommunications sectors, I transitioned into software engineering through an intensive bootcamp where I honed my skills in full stack development. Owing to my background in problem-solving, communication, and teamwork, combined with my passion for web development, I am well-equipped to tackle complex projects and collaborate effectively with teams. Iâ€™m excited to apply my skills to create meaningful, web-based applications. </h3>
